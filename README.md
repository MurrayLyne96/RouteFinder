This is the repository for the RouteFinder CoE project for Unosquare

# What is the application being made?
RouteFinder is a route generation tool designed to allow users to generate GPS routes for sport related activities, such as Running and cycling. Routes can be generated by specifying parameters, such as a start location, distance, maximum/minimum elevation in route, type of terrain and whether the route should be an end to end sprint or a circuit. Users can generate routes and save them to their profile, which in turn can be shared via a URL link. Users can also search for routes or do an area search with filter parameters. To aggregate good routes, users can like and favourite routes so that quality routes are given more visibility. On completion of a route users should be able to rate the route. At a bare minimum, users should be able specify the difficulty of the route but this can be expanded for other metrics such as views and fun factor.

# Who is this application for?
This application is intended for running and/or cycling atheletes who may use GPS tracking technology while exercising. The point of this application is to give a potential user the means to generate routes in an area they may not be familiar with or generate potential ideas for a new route as part of a new training routine. A similar feature exists in the fitness social media app Strava (https://www.strava.com/) however, this app focuses solely on the generation and sharing of routes, a routes database if you will, rather than being an athelete-orientated social media app. 

# How will this application be used?
Access to the app will depend if the user has an account or not. If the user does not have an account, they can search for routes by typing in an address or city/town name and specify a maximum range around the aforementioned location. If the user is logged in, they can login to the app an access a user dashboard. This dashboard will show the user their saved routes and the option to generate new routes. When generating new routes, the user will pick a starting location, and whether the route will be a circuit (where it will end at the start point) or a sprint (where the route will end at a different location). After this, the user can specify parameters such as how hilly the route will be, the desired length and what sort of terrain to use. An example of this would be choosing to avoid main roads or focus on offroad tracks only.
